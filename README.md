The application will allow users to manage three different types of properties the realty company offers to its customers: houses, condominiums, and apartments.

The program will ensure that the user enters only valid data for the various attributes requested (for example, the purchase price should only be a numeric value) and should prompt the user to re-enter data if incorrect values are entered by the user.
